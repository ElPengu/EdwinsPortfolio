Notes when creating this website
- Created virtual environment with Python
- Pip installed Django onto Python
- startproject in correct directory
- check server by "python manage.py runserver #PORTNUMBER"
- configure settings - this will allow us to run server with Django directly
- Created playground app
- Added urls.py file
- Map a view (lets say "hello") in views.py to urls.py
- Go to store front and to settings
- We include URLconf that was made in playground/urls.py
- Now default page has no response, but if you navigate to /playground/hello/ you will see a response!
