Welcome to the GitHub repository!

Directory - FirstFullWebsiteEdwin
NOTE: The project here is a work in progress that is being improved as you read this!
The personal website project is stored in this directory. To activate it...
1. Enter the directory
2. Create a virtual environment with Python: "py -m venv FirstFullWebsiteEdwin"
3. Activate the virtual environment: "FirstFullWebsiteEdwin\Scripts\activate.bat"
4. Run the server locally: "python manage.py runserver #PORTNUMBER". #PORTNUMBER may be 8001, for
example
If you have any issues with step 4, it is probably due to import faults. In this case, you must
import them. E.g., "py -m pip install Django".

To use the website, you have two options
1. Use the already-made account
2. Failing (1), register a new fake account

Already made account
- Username: testuser
- Password: testuserpass
