My attempts and notes for the Neetcode 150 course (a curated list of 150 LeetCode problems) are located here. The problems are arranged by pattern. 


**Directory - FirstFullWebsiteEdwin**

To access this website online, go to: https://pingu03.pythonanywhere.com/

To activate it on your local computer...

0. Download this project
1. Enter the FirstFullWebsite directory
2. (Optionally) create a virtual environment with Python: "py -m venv FirstFullWebsiteEdwin"
3. Activate the virtual environment: "FirstFullWebsiteEdwin\Scripts\activate.bat"
4. Run the server locally: "python manage.py runserver #PORTNUMBER". #PORTNUMBER may be 8001, for
example
If you have any issues with step 4, it is probably due to import faults. In this case, you must
import them. E.g., "py -m pip install Django".

NOTE: These instructions work on Windows. Use the analogous commands if you do not use Windows.
