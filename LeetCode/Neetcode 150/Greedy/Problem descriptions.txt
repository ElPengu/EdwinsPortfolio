Maximum Subarray
Medium
Given an array of integers nums, find the subarray with the largest sum and return the sum.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.



Jump Game
Medium
You are given an integer array nums where each element nums[i] indicates your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index starting from index 0, or false otherwise.



Jump Game II
Medium
You are given an array of integers nums, where nums[i] represents the maximum length of a jump towards the right from index i. For example, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any index i + j where:

j <= nums[i]
i + j < nums.length
You are initially positioned at nums[0].

Return the minimum number of jumps to reach the last position in the array (index nums.length - 1). You may assume there is always a valid answer.



Gas Station
Medium
There are n gas stations along a circular route. You are given two integer arrays gas and cost where:

gas[i] is the amount of gas at the ith station.
cost[i] is the amount of gas needed to travel from the ith station to the (i + 1)th station. (The last station is connected to the first station)
You have a car that can store an unlimited amount of gas, but you begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index such that you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction. If it's impossible, then return -1.

It's guaranteed that at most one solution exists.




Hand of Straights
Medium
You are given an integer array hand where hand[i] is the value written on the ith card and an integer groupSize.

You want to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size groupSize, and card values are consecutively increasing by 1.

Return true if it's possible to rearrange the cards in this way, otherwise, return false.





Merge Triplets to Form Target
Medium
You are given a 2D array of integers triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] represents the ith triplet. You are also given an array of integers target = [x, y, z] which is the triplet we want to obtain.

To obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets zero or more times:

Choose two different triplets triplets[i] and triplets[j] and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].
* E.g. if triplets[i] = [1, 3, 1] and triplets[j] = [2, 1, 2], triplets[j] will be updated to [max(1, 2), max(3, 1), max(1, 2)] = [2, 3, 2].

Return true if it is possible to obtain target as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.



Partition Labels
Medium
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase english letters.

We want to split the string into as many substrings as possible, while ensuring that each letter appears in at most one substring.

Return a list of integers representing the size of these substrings in the order they appear in the string.



Valid Parenthesis String
Medium
You are given a string s which contains only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*'.

Return true if s is valid, otherwise return false.

A string is valid if it follows all of the following rules:

Every left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
Every right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
A '*' could be treated as a right parenthesis ')' character or a left parenthesis '(' character, or as an empty string "".
