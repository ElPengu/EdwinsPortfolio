Valid Palindrome
Easy
Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.


Two Integer Sum II
Medium
Given an array of integers numbers that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return the indices (1-indexed) of two numbers, [index1, index2], such that they add up to a given target number target and index1 < index2. Note that index1 and index2 cannot be equal, therefore you may not use the same element twice.

There will always be exactly one valid solution.

Your solution must use O(1) additional space.


3Sum
Medium
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] where nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0, and the indices i, j and k are all distinct.
The output should not contain any duplicate triplets. You may return the output and the triplets in any order.


Container With Most Water
Medium
You are given an integer array heights where heights[i] represents the height of the ith bar.

You may choose any two bars to form a container. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
