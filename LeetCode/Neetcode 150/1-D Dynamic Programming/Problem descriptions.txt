Climbing Stairs
Easy
You are given an integer n representing the number of steps to reach the top of a staircase. You can climb with either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

Return the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of the staircase.

Min Cost Climbing Stairs
Easy
You are given an array of integers cost where cost[i] is the cost of taking a step from the ith floor of a staircase. After paying the cost, you can step to either the (i + 1)th floor or the (i + 2)th floor.

You may choose to start at the index 0 or the index 1 floor.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase, i.e. just past the last index in cost.


House Robber
Medium
You are given an integer array nums where nums[i] represents the amount of money the ith house has. The houses are arranged in a straight line, i.e. the ith house is the neighbor of the (i-1)th and (i+1)th house.

You are planning to rob money from the houses, but you cannot rob two adjacent houses because the security system will automatically alert the police if two adjacent houses were both broken into.

Return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.


House Robber II
Medium
You are given an integer array nums where nums[i] represents the amount of money the ith house has. The houses are arranged in a circle, i.e. the first house and the last house are neighbors.

You are planning to rob money from the houses, but you cannot rob two adjacent houses because the security system will automatically alert the police if two adjacent houses were both broken into.

Return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.


Longest Palindromic Substring
Medium
Given a string s, return the longest substring of s that is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

If there are multiple palindromic substrings that have the same length, return any one of them.


Palindromic Substrings
Medium
Given a string s, return the number of substrings within s that are palindromes.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.


Decode Ways
Medium
A string consisting of uppercase english characters can be encoded to a number using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
To decode a message, digits must be grouped and then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above. There may be multiple ways to decode a message. For example, "1012" can be mapped into:

"JAB" with the grouping (10 1 2)
"JL" with the grouping (10 12)
The grouping (1 01 2) is invalid because 01 cannot be mapped into a letter since it contains a leading zero.

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. You can assume that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.



Coin Change
Medium
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations (e.g. 1 dollar, 5 dollars, etc) and an integer amount representing a target amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up the exact target amount. If it is impossible to make up the amount, return -1.

You may assume that you have an unlimited number of each coin.


Maximum Product Subarray
Medium
Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product within the array and return it.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

You can assume the output will fit into a 32-bit integer.


Word Break
Medium
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.

You are allowed to reuse words in the dictionary an unlimited number of times. You may assume all dictionary words are unique.



Longest Increasing Subsequence
Medium
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "cat" is a subsequence of "crabt".


Partition Equal Subset Sum
Medium
You are given an array of positive integers nums.

Return true if you can partition the array into two subsets, subset1 and subset2 where sum(subset1) == sum(subset2). Otherwise, return false.
